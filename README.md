1 - Open the floor plan "play the game"

2 - Run in Dynamo player.

3 - A pop up will appear on your first run

Each run will:
Let you move: click your square and hit Esc key.
Let the PC move: random.

You must play in the floor plan but you can view in 3D.
The Os and Xs are 3D families. 

When the game is over you'll get another pop-up

Enjoy!
